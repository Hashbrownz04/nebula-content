// Answer the following questions in your own words
// 1. What is a function?
        /*A function is a building block filled with complex code.

// 2. Why is it useful?
        /*Functions are exactly complex mini-programs can be simply reused several times when needed,
        without having to rewrite the same set of complex code over and over.

// 3. Give a 'real world example'. Ours was wood chipper. Try and think of something yourself. 
        Let's say: We've made our pizza from scratch, and already it's raw. [The pizza is represented as a variable]
        We need to cook this pizza up, so we went and put it into a pizza oven. [This pizza oven is the function].
        The way of how the pizza oven heats it up is that the logs are set on fire and there's a metal rack overhead;
        The pizza is shelved on top.
        Finally, outcomes a well cooked pizza. [The final output]

// 4. There is different syntax / ways of defining a function write out the syntax for each:
// // A. Function declaration:
        function unnamed(parameter){
            const string = "line of code"
            return string
        }
// // B. Function expressions:
        const unnamed = function(parameter){
            const string = "line of code"
            return string
        }
// // C. Arrow functions: 
        const unnamed = (parameter) => {
            const string = "line of code"
            return string
        }

// 5. What is a parameter?
        /* A parameter refers to an input variable that is borrowed by a function to be used to complete
        the complex equation.

// 6. What is an argument?
        /* An argument is a given variable for the function.

// 7. What does the return statement do?
        /* The return statement returns the value of the variable that had been stored as a parameter.
        
// 8. What is scope? Do you have a real-world example of something similar to scope?
        /* You go into the college you've applied to, and you try and find the class you're supposed to go.*/
