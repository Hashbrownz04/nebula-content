## Instructor-Lead Activity

1. **Start with a Pre-Built Basic HTML Page**: Provide students with a simple HTML file (**`index.html`**) that includes various elements such as headings (h1, h2), paragraphs (p), and a list (ul, li). This page should have no styling to begin with.
2. **Step-by-Step CSS Introduction**:
    - **Step 1**: Guide students to create an external CSS file (**`styles.css`**) and link it to the HTML page. Explain the **`<link>`** tag in the HTML head.
    - **Step 2**: Start with simple CSS properties. For example, instruct them to change the color of all paragraph texts by adding **`p { color: blue; }`** to the **`style.css`** file.
    - **Step 3**: Introduce a few more properties like **`font-size`**, **`background-color`**, and **`text-align`**. Each step should be accompanied by a brief explanation and demonstration.
3. **Guided Practice with Immediate Results**:
    - After each new property or rule is introduced, students should apply it to the **`styles.css`** file and refresh their web page to see the changes. This immediate feedback helps in understanding the impact of CSS on HTML elements.
4. **Adding Comments in CSS**:
    - Teach students to add comments in their CSS file (**`/* This is a comment */`**) explaining what each rule does. This practice encourages understanding and good documentation habits.

### Expected Outcome

- Students will observe firsthand how CSS enhances a plain HTML document.
- They will learn basic CSS syntax and properties.
- By the end of the activity, students should be able to link an external stylesheet and apply simple styles to HTML elements.
