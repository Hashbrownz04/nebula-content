### Activity: Exploring the Effects of CSS Reset and Normalization

**Objective**: To understand the practical impact of using CSS Reset and Normalization on web design consistency.

**Task**:

1. Create a basic HTML page with various elements (headings, paragraphs, lists, tables).
2. Apply Meyer's Reset and observe the changes. Note how the browser's default styles are removed, leading to an "unstyled" look.
3. Replace Meyer's Reset with Normalize.css and observe the differences. Note how Normalize.css maintains certain useful default styles, leading to a more polished look without much additional CSS.
4. Reflect on how each approach (Reset vs. Normalization) impacts the starting point of web design.

**Expected Outcome**:

- Gain a practical understanding of how browser default styles, resets, and normalization affect web page appearance.
- Learn to choose appropriately between a CSS Reset and Normalization based on the design requirements of a project.
