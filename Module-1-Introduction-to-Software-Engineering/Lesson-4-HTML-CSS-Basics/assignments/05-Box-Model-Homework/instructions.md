## Activity: Building a Box Model Layout

**Objective**: Reinforce understanding of the Box Model and document flow through practical application.

**Task**:

1. **Create a Basic HTML Structure**: Include a variety of block and inline elements (like **`<div>`**, **`<p>`**, **`<span>`**, **`<h1>`**, etc.).
2. **Apply CSS Styling**:
    - Style each element to visibly differentiate content, padding, border, and margin (using different background colors, borders, etc.).
    - Experiment with different margin and padding values to observe their effects on layout and spacing.
3. **Experiment with Collapsing Margins**:
    - Create scenarios where vertical margins of adjacent elements collide, and demonstrate how to manage these effectively.

**Expected Outcome**:

- A clear visual representation of how the Box Model affects the layout of various elements.
- Understanding of how block and inline elements differ in their respect for margins, padding, and borders.
- Ability to recognize and resolve issues related to collapsing margins.
