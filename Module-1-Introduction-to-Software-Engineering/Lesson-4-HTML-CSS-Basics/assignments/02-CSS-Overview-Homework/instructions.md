### Activity: Creating a CSS Style Guide

**Objective**: Apply the learned concepts by creating a CSS style guide.

**Task**:

1. **Set Up a Basic HTML File**: Create an HTML file with various elements (headers, paragraphs, lists, etc.).
2. **Develop a CSS File**:
    - Define basic styles using different selectors.
    - Experiment with various units for font sizes, margins, and widths.
    - Implement CSS variables for colors and fonts to ensure consistency and easy maintenance.
    - Craft rules that demonstrate specificity and cascade (e.g., styling the same element differently using class and ID selectors).
3. **Document Your Styles**: Create comments in your CSS file explaining your choices, especially where specificity and cascade are concerned.

**Expected Outcome**:

- A well-structured CSS file that clearly shows the use of selectors, properties, and values.
- Practical application of different units and their impact on design.
- Effective use of CSS variables for streamlined styling.
- A better understanding of how specificity and cascade influence the final styling.
